# CIS453_courseProject
This course project is a culmination of a MGBD parts Website redesign. 
Throughout the alloted four weeks, I have created my final design using the React web framework. 
The final revisions were made possible with the help of my peer @Courtney Issac. 
Using a combination of the feedback I received from him along with my own thoughts for further improvements,
I was able to add several content sections to my single page application.

# Final Revisions 
I have added a background image in lieu of the original gradient color I chose.
I have also added links and images to my parts tab page in addition to adding text to my home page in response to the feedback I recieved.
